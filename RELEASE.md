# Secure Sockets

## What's Included?
Refer to the [README.md](./README.md) for a complete description of the Secure Sockets Library.

## Known Issues
| Problem | Workaround |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is not supported in the Secure Sockets Library | Currently, no workaround is available. Support will be added in a future release. |
| TLS client connection takes around 25 seconds in PKCS mode for RSA keys due to the limitation of hardware crypto for RSA. | It is recommended to use ECDHE keys for the client connection. Connection time improvement for RSA keys will be addressed in a future release. |
| IAR 9.40.2 toolchain throws build errors on Debug mode, if application explicitly includes iar_dlmalloc.h file | Add '--advanced_heap' to LDFLAGS in application Makefile. |
| Socket receive fails if application establishes TLS1.3 connection to a server where session tickets are enabled. This is due to the bug in third party MBEDTLS library | Disable session tickets on the server side. |
